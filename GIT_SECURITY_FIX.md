# 🔒 Git Security Fix Complete

## ✅ What Was Fixed

**Problem:** GitHub blocked your push because real API keys were detected in `railway.env`

**Solution:** Replaced all real API keys with safe placeholder values

---

## 🛡️ Security Changes Made

### Before (❌ DANGEROUS):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-real-key-here  # 🚨 Real key exposed!
HEYGEN_API_KEY=real-heygen-key        # 🚨 Security risk!
```

### After (✅ SAFE):
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here  # 🛡️ Placeholder only
HEYGEN_API_KEY=your-heygen-api-key-here     # 🛡️ Safe to commit
```

---

## 🚀 Ready to Push

Your code is now safe to commit and push:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "🔒 Fix: Replace API keys with safe placeholders"
git push origin edmundv3
```

## 🔧 Setting Real Values in Railway

**Method 1: Railway Dashboard (Recommended)**
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Select your StreamGank project  
3. Go to **Variables** tab
4. Add each variable with your **real** values:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY = sk-proj-your-real-key-here
HEYGEN_API_KEY = your-real-heygen-key  
CREATOMATE_API_KEY = your-real-creatomate-key
CLOUDINARY_URL = cloudinary://your-real-url
```

**Method 2: Railway CLI**
```bash
railway variables --set "OPENAI_API_KEY=your-real-openai-key"
railway variables --set "HEYGEN_API_KEY=your-real-heygen-key"
railway variables --set "CREATOMATE_API_KEY=your-real-creatomate-key"
railway variables --set "CLOUDINARY_URL=your-real-cloudinary-url"
```
